# puppet-parrots

**ZuZu and Zaza** are our Puppet Parrot Ambassadors! We would love to have a page on our website that communicates who they are and what they do.

##### These roles include:
- helping children in schools in Mozambique learn and share ideas on nutrition;
- being the most memorable part of our Children for Health workshops; 
- putting a smile on the face of the many officials we have to meet in our work; 
- and featuring as characters in our story book series. 

ZuZu is the older brother of his younger sister Zaza. He is quite wise and looks after ZaZa but he also likes to have fun and often gets caught up in ZaZa's mischief. 

Many of our users access content on their mobile phones so it has to be designed with **low bandwidth** and **mobile** in mind.

      <section class="why">
        <h1>Why use the puppets?</h1>
        <p>Children can speak confidently through the puppets to tackle issues that may be too sensitive otherwise, like malnutrition and HIV.
        </p>
        <p>The parrots also encourage young boys to help out at home by ZuZu being a responsible older brother to ZaZa, his younger sister. </p>
        <p>The puppets can take on any role to help raise health awareness.

      <section class="how">
        <h1>How the puppets are reaching children in Mozambique?</h1>
        <p>ZuZu and ZaZa were first introduced in January 2014. A dozen of puppet parrot pairs were distributed to 12 pilot schools in <a href="https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Tsangano,+Mozambique/@-15.0843359,34.2881873,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x1927444dbd1667a1:0x6c231f72f0c4fe9f">Tsangano</a>, Tete Province. A camera was given to each school to document the programme.
        </p>
        <p>By May 2015, the documented programme is a great success and keeps developing.

            …the dialogue continues about how to persuade parents to buy soap. A further dialogue can be about using a tap and soap for hand washing that uses little water.

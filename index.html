      <section class="WHY">
        <h2>Why puppets?</h2>
        <p>Children can speak ‘through’ the puppets to tackle issues that may be too sensitive otherwise, like nutrition and HIV.</p>
        <p>To reverse the common gender role of older girls looking after their younger siblings and encourage boys to help out, Zuzu is an ‘older brother’ to Zaza. The puppets can also take on other personalities as needed.</p>

      <section class="HOW">
        <h2>How playing with them helps nutrition in Mozambique?</h2>
        <p>The puppets were first introduced in January 2014. A dozen of ZuZu and Zaza pairs were distributed to 12 pilot schools in
          Tsangano, Tete Province alongside a camera for each school to document the programme.</p>
        <p>By May the documented programme turned out to be a success.</p>

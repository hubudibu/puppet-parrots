      <section class="why">
        <h1>Why use puppets?</h1>
        <p>Children can speak comfortably through the puppets to tackle issues that may be too sensitive otherwise, like malnutrition and HIV.
        </p>
        <p>The parrots also encourage young boys to help out at home by Zuzu being a responsible older brother to Zaza. </p>
        <p>The puppets can take on any role to help raise health awareness.

      <section class="how">
        <h1>How puppets reach mozambique children?</h1>
        <p>Zuzu and Zaza were first introduced in January 2014. A dozen of puppet parrot pairs were distributed to 12 pilot schools in <a href="https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Tsangano,+Mozambique/@-15.0843359,34.2881873,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x1927444dbd1667a1:0x6c231f72f0c4fe9f">Tsangano</a>, Tete Province. A camera was given to each school to document the programme.
        </p>
        <p>By May the documented programme turned out to be a success and kept developing.

          <ul>
            <li class='slide1'>
              Give the children a health topic to build a story around
            </li>
            <li class='slide2'>
              Ask children to create a role play that includes a dialogue between the parrots. Children can develop these in small groups or in pairs. The children who do not have the puppets can be other ‘characters’ in the story
            </li>
            <li class='slide3'>
              Let children practice
            </li>
            <li class='slide4'>
              Have children perform the dialogue to their friends
            </li>
            <li class='slide5'>
              After the dialogue let children ask Zuzu and Zaza questions
            </li>
            <li class='slide6'>
              Let children answer the questions with the help of their teachers

        <blockquote>
          Zaza is washing her beak in water. Zuzu comes along and see what she is doing. Zuzu says, “You know Zaza it may be wonderful to splash in that water but it will not get your beak clean! Dirt and germs are invisible and if you want to properly clean them you have to use soap. Soap is wonderful too it makes you smell fresh!
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          …the dialogue continues about how to persuade parents to buy soap. A further dialogue can be about using a tap and soap for hand washing that uses little water.

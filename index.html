      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why use puppets?</h2>
        <p>Children can speak comfortably through the puppets to tackle issues that may be too sensitive otherwise, like malnutrition and HIV.
        </p>
        <p>The parrots also encourage young boys to help out at home by Zuzu being a responsible older brother to Zaza. </p>
        <p>The puppets can take on any role to help raise health awareness.

      <section class="how">
        <h2>How puppets reach mozambique children?</h2>
        <p>Zuzu and Zaza were first introduced in January 2014. A dozen of puppet parrot pairs were distributed to 12 pilot schools in Tsangano, Tete Province. A camera was given to each school to document the programme.
        </p>
        <p>By May the documented programme turned out to be a success and kept developing.
